# # Unique Bucket Names (create bucket)
#
# Buckets can be created with the **create_bucket** method on **boto3**, and are expected to fail with a `BucketAlreadyExists` error if there's already another bucket created, by any user of the system on any region, with the same name. The bucket names namespace is global.

# ## Setup


# +
# Import shared functions
from s3_helpers import print_timestamp, create_s3_client, generate_unique_bucket_name

print_timestamp()

# Create S3 client
s3_client = create_s3_client(profile_name)

# Generate a unique bucket name
bucket_name = generate_unique_bucket_name(base_name="test-unique-bucket-name")
print(f'test bucket will be named {bucket_name}')

# ## Examples

# ### Create bucket
#
# Attempt to create the bucket - Expect Success


# +
# Delete it if it exists and it's yours
try:
    s3_client.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
except s3_client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket:
    pass
    
print(f"Bucket creation initiated.")
response = s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
print(f'Created with Location: {response.get("Location")}')

# Use waiter to confirm the bucket exists
waiter = s3_client.get_waiter('bucket_exists')
waiter.wait(Bucket=bucket_name)
print(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' confirmed as created.")
# -


# ### Create the same bucket
# Attempt to create the same bucket again - Expect failure


try:
    s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
    # If no error is raised, fail the test
    raise AssertionError("Expected BucketAlreadyExists error, but bucket was created successfully.")
except s3_client.exceptions.BucketAlreadyExists:
    print(f"Bucket '{bucket_name}' already exists, as expected.")

# ## Teardown

# Use waiter to confirm the bucket doesnt exists
